# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Provided the ride and city data for PyBer, using Python and Pandas, we were tasked with the following:
  1. Creating a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  2. Creating a multiple-line chart of total fare for each city type
  3. Creating a written report for the Pyber analysis

## Resources
- Data Sources: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- Software: Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Supplied with the data below, we can see clear differences in each of the city types, which are Rural, Suburban, and Urban. Let's look closer at the data and state the differences.

Immediately when we look at the data, we see that the number of total rides in each area vastly varries. Urban is at 1,625, Suburban is at 625, and Rural is at 125. This more than likely depends on the population of each city, but it ends up affecting the total amount of drivers and then the total fare. Since Urban has the most total rides, it makes sense for it to have the most total drivers. This also has the same correlation to the total fare. We can also find the average fare per ride by dividing the total fare by the total rides and the average far per driver by diving total fare by total drivers.

## Summary
In conclusion, PyBer seems to be thriving the most in Urban areas as opposed to Rural and Suburban. To summarize so opportunities for the buisness, here is a list of some suggestions:
- In order to increase productivity in areas like Rural and Suburban, it might be best to somehow implement some sort of deal/discount in order to increase demand, or lower fare prices all together.
- Because Urban rides are in such high demand, it could be opportunistic to increase the fare price in order to make a higher profit.
- Have more driver diversity, meaning more in Rural and Suburban areas, especially if the first suggestion is implemented. More drivers might actually be encoraged to work in those areas regardless since the average fare per driver is already so much higher than in Urban areas.
