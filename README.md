# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Provided the ride and city data for PyBer, using Python and Pandas, we were tasked with the following:
  1. Creating a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
  2. Creating a multiple-line chart of total fare for each city type
  3. Creating a written report for the Pyber analysis

## Resources
- Data Sources: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- Software: Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Supplied with the data below, we can see clear differences in each of the city types, which are Rural, Suburban, and Urban. Let's look closer at the data and state the differences.

Immediately when we look at the data, we see that the number of total rides in each area vastly varries. Urban is at 1,625, Suburban is at 625, and Rural is at 125. This more than likely depends on the population of each city, but it ends up affecting the total amount of drivers and then the total fare. Since Urban has the most total rides, it makes sense for it to have the most total drivers. This also has the same correlation to the total fare.
